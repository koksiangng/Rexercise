# Searching for words in files.

1. Start cmd
2. Navigate to where "build.sbt" can be seen, which in this case is directly after the "Main"-folder and issue following commands:
  a. sbt
  b. runMain Main directoryContainingTextFiles
  c. Search using any words. It's expected that the words are "sane" and that the words are seperated with a space, e.g. (Hej Nej)
